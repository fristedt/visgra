# Slide 3
Continuous real objects are represented by a finite set of locations, or samples, in space/time.
This is called a discrete structure.

Grid terminology: point (0d), line (1d), face, voxel

## Data connectivity

Structured grid: connectivity is implicitly given
	- Block-structured grid: combination of several structured grids
Refers to the implicitly given connectivity between the grid vertices

Unstructured grid: connectivity is explicitly given

Hybrid grid: combination of different grid types

## Regular or uniform grids
Cells are rectangles or rectangular cuboids of the same size

All grid lines are parallel to the axes

To define a uniform grid, we need the following:
Bounding box: ( x min , y min , z min) - ( x max , y max , z max)
Number of grid vertices in each dimension: 
	D x , D y , D z 
	Cell size: d x , d y , d z 

Cartesian grid

Special case of a uniform grid: dx = dy = dz
Consists of squares (2D), cubes (3D)

## Linear interpolation

f(x) = ((x1 - x) / (x1 - x0)) f(x0) + ((x - x0) / (x1 - x0)) f(x1)

## Bilinear interpolation

f(x, y) = (1 - x)(1 - y)f_{00} + x(1 - y)f_{10} + (1 - x)yf_{01} + xyf_{11}

### Continuities
Does a particle moving on this curve have a smooth 
trajectory?

	- C⁰: (discontinuous first derivative) Use higher order interpolation
	  for smoother transition, e.g., cubic interpolation, not smooth
	- C¹: Smooth derivative curve
	- C²: Smooth second derivative curve
	- C³: - || - third

C - requires that the vectors to and from the intersection point are equal
G - same as C, but does not require the above

## Function Derivative Estimation (gradients)

\/f(x, y, z) = [d/dx, d/dy, d/dz]
f(x, y, z) = [df/dx, df/dy, df/dz]
Describes direction of steepest ascent

## Linear Interpolation in a Triangle

A linear function f(x, y) = a + bx + cy
Polynomial can be obtained by solving the linear system
	[1 x0 y0 [a   [f0
	 1 x1 y1  b =  f1
	 1 x2 y2] c]   f2]
- Linear in x and y

## Barycentric coordinates

p = ap1 + bp2 + cp3 with a + b + c = 1

### Barycentric interpolation in a triangle

f(x, y) = a0(x, y)f0 + a1(x, y)f1 + a2(x, y)f2
with a0 + a1 + a2 = 1 (barycentric coordinates)
f0, f1, f2 are the corner vertices of the triangle

Can also solve for unknown coefficients a (cramers rule):
	[x0 x1 x2 [a0   [x
	 y0 y1 y2  a1 =  y
	 1  1  1]  a2]   1]

Gradient of a linearly interpolated function in a 
triangle/tetrahedron: Constant!

## Geometric modeling

Geometry describes the form and the position/orientation in a 
coordinate system.

Topology defines the fundamental structure that is invariant against 
continuous transformations.
